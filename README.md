### What is VaporSVG?

  VaporSVG is a landing page created by me while studying svg, which I'll be using as a placeholder page while I develop my website.

### Running the website locally

This is a basic static website, but before you run *index.html* in your browser, you have to go through 2 steps:

1. In the terminal, run ```npm install```
2. Now, load the icons, CSS and other otimizations running ```npm run gulp```. (**TODO:** Gulp 'watch' task with *browserSync*)

Once you have done so, just execute the *index.html* file in your browser
