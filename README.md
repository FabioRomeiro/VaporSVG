### What is VaporSVG?

  VaporSVG is a landing page created by me while studying svg, which I'll be using as a placeholder page while I develop my website.

### Running the website locally

This is a basic static website, but to make the development process faster and easier I choose to use a task runner (Gulp); If you want to run the webpage locally, go through this 2 steps:

1. In the terminal, run ```npm install``` to install the dependences (make sure you're in the right directory)
2. Execute the application with ```npm run dev```

Once you have done so, your browser should open and load the website automatically, but if it don't, run this address: *http://localhost:3000*
